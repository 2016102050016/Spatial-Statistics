# Spatial-Statistics
The repository contains methods and applications of spatial-statistics, like Quad-tree based Fast and Adaptive Kernel Density Estimation(QFA-KDE) for Hundreds of Millions of points 
More specifically, four bandwidth selection methods of KDE are includedï¼š

(1) two fixed KDE bandwidth selection methods :rule of thumb & corss-validation based fixed KDE
(2) two adaptive KDE bandwidth selection methods: cross-validation based adaptive KDE & QFA-KDE

Further more, two kinds of datasets are included for experiments:
(1) POI dataset: regional clustered data/Hubei enterprise registration data POI (Li et al.,2018)
(2) GPS trajectory dataset: linear clustered data
