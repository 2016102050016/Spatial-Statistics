# Spatial-Statistics
The repository contains methods of spatial-statistics, so far especially Kernel Density Estimation(KDE) methods
***
More specifically, four bandwidth selection methods of KDE are included:  
* two fixed KDE bandwidth selection methods :***rule of thumb*** & ***corss-validation based fixed KDE***  
* two adaptive KDE bandwidth selection methods: ***cross-validation based adaptive KDE*** & ***QFA-KDE***  
***
Further more, two kinds of datasets are included for experiments:  
* POI dataset: regional clustered data/Hubei enterprise registration data POI (Li et al.,2018)  
* GPS trajectory dataset: linear clustered data
